  <h1>Mapping the Invisible: Migrant Deaths at Sea</h1>
  <p>This interactive dashboard and report explores the spatial patterns of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean using openly available data and geospatial analysis techniques. The aim is to go beyond the numbers and highlight the human cost of migration.</p>

  <section id="motivation">
    <h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>In Vienna, anti-migrant slogans often dominate public space during election campaigns. But behind every statistic are real people – families, children, individuals displaced by war, persecution or disaster. No one risks their life at sea unless the alternative is worse.</p>
    <p>This project aims to shift the focus from statistics back to people. By visualising where migrant deaths occur and using geospatial methods to understand patterns, we want to raise awareness and encourage data-informed public debate.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="source">
    <h2>Data Source</h2>
    <h3>The Organisation</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Organisation:</strong> International Organization for Migration (IOM)</li>
      <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> Missing Migrants Project (est. 2014)</li>
      <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Document deaths and disappearances of people during migration worldwide</li>
      <li><strong>Motivation:</strong> Raise awareness, inform policy, and improve protection</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Dataset</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time Span:</strong> 2014–2025 (ongoing)</li>
      <li><strong>Data Type:</strong> Point data including location, date, number of dead/missing/survivors, and cause of death</li>
      <li><strong>Updates:</strong> Continuous updates from NGOs, official sources and media</li>
      <li><strong>Limitations:</strong> Many missing fields (e.g. origin, gender, age); underreporting likely</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section id="evaluation">
    <h2>Evaluation of Patterns</h2>
    <p>We applied various spatial techniques – heatmaps, clustering, and spatial autocorrelation – to understand where and how migrant deaths concentrate. Heatmaps revealed intensity hotspots, KMeans and DBSCAN clustering showed spatial groupings of incidents, and LISA highlighted statistically significant clusters.</p>
    <p>What does this mean? Migrant deaths are not random. They follow dangerous sea routes, often shaped by border policies, geography, and smuggling networks. These tools help make sense of tragedy and can guide policy to prevent future loss of life.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Migrant deaths at sea represent not just a data problem, but a humanitarian one. Through this dashboard, we hope to refocus attention on the individual lives behind the statistics – and to call for safer, legal migration pathways.</p>
    <p>Geospatial analysis gave us a powerful toolset, but the purpose remains human: remembrance, awareness, and a demand for action.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="limitations">
    <h2>Data Limitations & Future Work</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Incomplete data on origin, cause, or gender in many cases</li>
      <li>No data on attempted crossings – the full risk is unknown</li>
      <li>Temporal inconsistencies due to delays in reporting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Future steps could include linking these patterns to policy events or weather data, and expanding analysis using regression models or machine learning.</p>
